    // Daemon-Network reported that anime badges didn't fire on his
    // library despite items being tagged. Two root causes: (a) v2.0.x
    // only checked Genres, never Tags; (b) Episodes typically don't
    // inherit Genres from their parent Series in Jellyfin's metadata
    // model, so an "Anime"-tagged Series produces episodes with empty
    // genre arrays at playback. v2.1.0 fixes both, AND lets admins
    // configure the heuristic explicitly in case their library shape
    // is unusual.

    /// <summary>Library names that should count every item as anime,

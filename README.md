# 🏆 Achievement Badges for Jellyfin

A full progression, gamification and achievement system for Jellyfin that rewards users based on real viewing activity. Think Xbox Gamerscore meets Letterboxd, built natively into your media server.

> **Status:** Active development — **v1.8.x** turns the Friends drawer into a full **messaging suite** (Xbox-style 1:1 chat + group chats, image attachments, read receipts, edit/delete, block, browser notifications, message sound, per-peer mute). Prior highlights from v1.7.x: Friends drawer, admin quest customization, public equipped-badge previews, rarity percentage chip, hand-translated **French by [@frenchyx24](https://github.com/frenchyx24)** (all 171 badges), full **security audit** pass, and a **3-layer data-loss recovery chain**.

## ✨ Overview

Over **170 built-in achievements** across 30+ categories, a 10-tier rank ladder from Rookie to Immortal, a score economy with combos, prestige, and daily/weekly quests, plus admin power features like custom badges, seasonal challenges, webhook notifications and a full audit log.

Designed to integrate cleanly with modern Jellyfin setups and themes like NetFin, ElegantFin, or StarTrack.

---

## 🧩 Core features

### 🏅 Badge system
- **170+ built-in achievements** across Films, Series, Binge, Night Watching, Morning, Weekend, Exploration, Streaks, Episode/Film Marathons, Eras, World, Languages, Genres, Runtime, Total Time, Holidays (Christmas, New Year, Halloween, Eid), Library Completion, Loyalty, People, Rewatch, and Hidden categories
- **6 rarity tiers** — Common, Uncommon, Rare, Epic, Legendary, Mythic
- **Hidden/secret badges** displayed as `???` until unlocked
- **Library completion milestones** that auto-scale to any library structure
- **Per-person tracking** — Director and Actor affinity badges
- **Per-genre tracking** — unique genre counters with dedicated badges
- **Era / country / language** breakdowns via item metadata
- **Watch streaks** — current and best streak badges
- **Daily login streak** — loyalty rewards for consistent visits

### 🎖️ Rank system
- **10 tiers** from Rookie → Novice → Viewer → Regular → Enthusiast → Binger → Connoisseur → Maestro → Legend → Immortal
- Rank computed from your achievement score with progress bar to next tier
- **Theme unlocks** — the achievements page changes gradient/border color as you climb
- Sidebar badge showcase + header dots display your current equipped badges at a glance

### 💰 Score economy
- Every playback accrues 5 base points into a **score bank**
- **Combo multiplier** — consecutive watches within 15 minutes stack up to +100% bonus
- **Spend bank** to buy locked badges directly
- **Gift score** to other users on your server
- Rarity-based badge scoring (10-150 pts), scaled by prestige level

### ⭐ Prestige
- Reach Legend rank (12,000 score) to unlock prestige
- **Resets badges + counters** but keeps your lifetime score and awards a prestige star
- Each prestige level adds a **+50% score multiplier** to future badge unlocks
- Visible on profile and leaderboard

### 🎯 Daily & weekly quests
- **3 concurrent daily quests** rotating from 12 built-in templates
- **3 concurrent weekly quests** rotating from 8 built-in templates
- Deterministic rotation — everyone on the server gets the same quests per day/week
- Completing quests pays into the score bank
- **Admin quest customization** (new in v1.7.0) — add / edit / remove daily + weekly quests from the admin page, replace built-in quests by Id, or disable built-ins your server can't satisfy

### 👥 Friends (new in v1.7.x)
- **Bi-directional** friendship with a proper **request / accept** flow — nobody follows you silently
- **Global floating button** anchored bottom-left on every Jellyfin page — not just the achievements tab. Auto-hides on `/dashboard` + `/plugins` pages and during media playback; reappears as soon as you leave either state
- **Xbox-guide-style side drawer** with three sub-tabs: Friends / Requests / Find
- **Jellyfin profile-image avatars** per friend row (initials fall back when no image is set)
- **Online / offline** status pulled live from Jellyfin's `ISessionManager`, with a 15-minute grace window so casual browsing still counts as online (not just active playback)
- **Now playing** display — see the series + episode title each online friend is watching
- Each friend's **equipped badges** shown next to their row (respects their privacy prefs)
- **Type-to-search** user picker in the Find tab (not a giant dropdown of every server user)
- **Red unread badge** on the floating button + Requests tab when someone has sent you a friend request
- **Mutual** indicator on friend rows; **Auto-accept** kicks in if the target has already sent a request to you
- **Privacy toggles** in user settings: *Appear offline to friends* (always shows you as offline) and *Hide what I'm watching* (still online, but the series/episode is hidden). Enforced server-side in `FriendsService.BuildFriendRow` — can't be bypassed by client tampering
- **Compact request rows** — Accept / Decline / Cancel buttons are icon-only with tooltips, so the Requests tab doesn't visually bloat

### 💬 Messaging (new in v1.8)

Xbox-Guide-style chat built into the Friends drawer. No external service, no WebSockets, everything stored on your own server.

- **Messages tab** next to Friends / Requests / Find, with threads newest-first, avatars, last-message preview + timestamp, and a per-conversation unread count
- **1:1 DMs** and **group chats** (2–20 participants, named, rename + leave + members list)
- **Image attachments** — PNG / JPEG / GIF / WebP up to 8 MB, server-side magic-byte verification so nobody can smuggle a `.exe` renamed to `.png`. Click-to-zoom lightbox
- **Read receipts** — single green ✓ for delivered, double green ✓✓ for read. Per-participant `readBy` map so group receipts work too
- **Edit and delete** your own messages via WhatsApp-style dropdown — click anywhere on your own bubble to open the menu, 24-hour edit window
- **Clear conversation** button in the chat gear menu (wipes both sides, confirm dialog)
- **Block user** — bi-directional; existing messages kept, new ones rejected. Stored in `UserAchievementProfile.Preferences.BlockedUsers`
- **Per-peer mute** (localStorage-only, no server round-trip) + **per-user prefs** in the standalone settings panel:
  - Master message-notifications toggle
  - Message sound (subtle Web Audio chime, no audio file)
  - **Mute during playback** — suppresses notifications while Jellyfin's video player is active
- **Notifications**:
  - In-app toast (top-center, 5s auto-dismiss, click to open the thread)
  - Browser Notification API when the tab isn't visible and permission is granted
  - Sound chime on inbound message
- **Unread indicators** — pulsing red dot on the chat button in the friends list + count pill on the Messages tab + combined badge on the floating friends button
- **Anti-flicker rendering** — content-hashed; the chat pane only repaints when something actually changed, preserving scroll position
- **Auto-polling** — 6 s inside an open chat, 8 s on the Messages tab, 20 s drawer-wide when closed; all small, all `[Authorize]`-gated
- **Rate limits** — 20 messages per minute per sender, max 1000 chars per message, 2000-message FIFO cap per conversation
- **Friendship gate** — only mutual friends can DM; group creators can only add their own friends. Admin's `FriendsSimpleMode` treats the whole server as one friend list for messaging too
- **Storage** — single `messages.json` + `attachments.json` + `attachments/<id>.<ext>` on disk under `plugins/configurations/achievementbadges/`. Atomic writes via temp file + `File.Move` so a crash mid-send can't corrupt the store. Messages survive server restarts

### 🏅 Rarity percentage chip (new in v1.7.6)
- Every badge card on the achievements page shows a coloured chip with the **% of users on your server** who have unlocked that badge
- **Green ≥ 50%** (common on this server), **amber 10–50%** (uncommon), **red < 10%** (rare / flex-worthy)
- Fed by a `/badges/rarity-stats` endpoint with a 5-minute server-side cache so it doesn't re-scan every profile on every page load
- Scarcity signal lets users see "nobody else on this server has this badge" at a glance

### 💾 Data-loss recovery chain (v1.7.5+)
- `Load()` walks **primary `badges.json` → `.bak` → `.recovery`** before giving up. A flaky primary file with a clean backup recovers silently
- `.bak` is rotated on every successful save
- `.recovery` captures in-session state when the primary is quarantined, so restart never feels like a fresh reset
- `LastLoadSummary` exposed via the `/test` endpoint so admins can see recovery activity
- Unparseable primary files are quarantined to `badges.json.corrupt-<timestamp>` (not deleted) for manual recovery

### 📊 Stats & visualization
- **Recap tab** — weekly / monthly / yearly breakdowns with top genres, directors, actors
- **Watch heatmap** — GitHub-style calendar (30/90/180/365 day range) colored by intensity
- **Genre radar chart** — SVG spider chart of your genre distribution
- **Stats snapshot** — histogram of unlocked / score / best streak
- **Category leaderboards** — Score, Movies, Episodes, Hours, Best Streak, Series

### 🏠 UI integration
- **Sidebar entry** auto-injected into the Jellyfin nav menu (works on web, iOS, and Android after restart)
- **Equipped badge showcase** in header + profile (configurable slot count, 1-10)
- **Xbox-style unlock toasts** with per-rarity colors (6 tiers), Xbox logo → trophy swap, shimmer sweep, and confetti on rare+ unlocks
- **Achievement sound** — Xbox 360 chime for common/uncommon, rare Xbox One chime for rare/epic/legendary/mythic
- **Diamond spritesheet** for legendary/mythic unlocks (147-frame rotating crystal animation)
- **One-at-a-time toast queue** — multiple simultaneous unlocks play sequentially so each gets its full animation
- **Toasts during playback** — unlocks fire within ~1s of earning via playback event hooks + DOM fallback
- **Admin toast preview** — test buttons for each rarity tier
- **Standalone achievements page** at `#!/achievements`
- **Shareable profile card** — server-rendered HTML at `/Plugins/AchievementBadges/users/{id}/profile-card`

### ⚙️ User preferences
A gear icon on the achievements page opens a full settings panel with auto-save:
- **Toast controls** — enable/disable toasts, sound, confetti, milestone toasts
- **Minimum toast rarity** — filter out common spam (All / Rare+ / Epic+ / Legendary+)
- **Privacy** — hide from leaderboard, compare profiles, activity feed, prestige board
- **Achievement page themes** — Default, Dark, or Light (scoped to achievements page only, doesn't affect Jellyfin)
- **Spoiler mode** — hides locked badge descriptions with "???" so you discover them naturally
- **Equipped badge slots** — choose how many badges show in your showcase (1-10)
- **Auto-equip new unlocks** — newly earned badges automatically fill empty slots

### 🌍 Languages
- **8 languages** — English, Français, Español, Deutsch, Italiano, Português, 中文 (简体), 日本語
- **659 UI keys** translated across every tab (achievements profile, stats, heatmap, streak calendar, prestige leaderboard, notification prefs, server stats, compare, leaderboards, recap, quests, admin page)
- **All 171 built-in badges** translated — titles + descriptions per language
- **Badge categories + rarities** also localised ("Binge" → "Marathon", "Legendary" → "Légendaire", etc.)
- **Per-user language picker** in preferences; admin can set a server-wide default
- Translations loaded client-side + server-side (`BadgeLocalizer`) so both UI chrome and badge titles on the leaderboard / showcase localise together

### 🛠️ Admin features
- **Feature Controls** — kill switches for leaderboard, compare, activity feed, prestige, quests
- **Force Privacy Mode** — override all users to hidden from all social features
- **Max Equipped Badges** — server-wide cap (1-10)
- **Restrict Badge Visibility** — users can only see their own badges
- **Disable Badge Categories** — hide entire categories (e.g. "Late Night" for family servers)
- **Custom Welcome Message** — text shown on the achievements page
- **Reset User Progress** — wipe a specific user's badges via admin endpoint
- **Enable/disable individual badges** — useful if your server can't satisfy some criteria
- **Visual badge editor** — form-based creator for custom badges
- **JSON editor** alternative for power users
- **Seasonal challenges** — time-limited goals with start/end dates
- **Challenge templates** — one-click add for Monthly Marathon, October Horror, New Year, Summer Blockbuster
- **Webhook notifications** — Discord/Slack-compatible POST on every unlock
- **Audit log** — last 5,000 unlock events with timestamps
- **Progress injection** — set arbitrary counter values for testing / gifting
- **Admin auth lockdown** — all admin endpoints require elevated permissions

### 🔒 Tracking
- **Watch history backfill** — scans existing Jellyfin play history to retroactively award badges on install
- **Auto-evaluation on startup** — new badges from plugin updates auto-unlock if your existing counters already satisfy them, no manual scan needed
- **Live playback tracker** — unlocks fire during viewing, past the 80% completion threshold
- **Rewatch detection** — dedupes within 6 hours, counts rewatches beyond that
- **People metadata extraction** — uses `ILibraryManager.GetPeople()` for directors/actors

---

## ⚙️ Installation

1. Go to **Dashboard → Plugins → Repositories**
2. Add:

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ZL154/AchievementBadges_for_Jellyfin/main/manifest.json
```

3. Save and refresh plugins
4. Install **Achievement Badges**
5. Restart Jellyfin
6. Go to **Dashboard → Plugins → Achievement Badges → Settings**
7. Click **Scan watch history** (or **Scan all users**) to backfill from your existing play data
8. Explore `#!/achievements` to see your profile

---

## 🔧 Requirements

- **Jellyfin 10.11+**
- **File Transformation plugin** (strongly recommended) — ensures sidebar, dashboard UI, profile showcase and achievements page inject reliably across Jellyfin Web updates. Without it most UI injection still works via the plugin's own middleware, but File Transformation gives the most robust integration.

### Optional but helpful

- **Proper metadata provider** (TMDb, OMDb) — required for Director/Actor badges to populate. Badges based on `item.People` will stay empty if your library doesn't have people scraped
- **Home Screen Sections plugin** — lets the achievement home widget inject more reliably

### What each feature needs

| Feature | Depends on |
|---|---|
| Sidebar + header injection | Nothing (works standalone) |
| Watch history backfill | Played flag on items (Jellyfin default) |
| Genre badges | Items with `Genres` metadata |
| Director/Actor badges | Items with `People` metadata (TMDb/OMDb scrape) |
| Era / decade badges | Items with `ProductionYear` metadata |
| Country badges | Items with `ProductionLocations` metadata |
| Language badges | Items with `OriginalLanguage` metadata |
| Runtime badges | Items with `RunTimeTicks` populated |
| Library completion | At least one library folder with items |
| Webhook notifications | A webhook URL (Discord, Slack, or generic) |

---

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Sidebar / toasts / UI not showing up

The plugin injects its scripts into Jellyfin's `index.html` at startup. If the web directory isn't writable, the injection fails silently and no UI loads (no sidebar entry, no toasts, no achievements page).

**Diagnose:** visit `https://your-server/Plugins/AchievementBadges/test` — the JSON response shows:
- `DiagIndexFound` — whether `index.html` was located
- `DiagIndexPatched` — whether the script tags were successfully written
- `DiagLastError` — the exact error if patching failed (usually `Unauthorized: Access denied`)

**Common cause:** on Docker or Linux installs, Jellyfin doesn't have write access to `/usr/share/jellyfin/web/`. Fix by granting write permission:

```bash
# Docker: run inside the container
chmod -R a+w /usr/share/jellyfin/web/

# Systemd: fix ownership
sudo chown -R jellyfin:jellyfin /usr/share/jellyfin/web/
```

Then restart Jellyfin. The plugin will patch `index.html` on the next startup.

**Still broken?** The plugin has a middleware fallback that rewrites `index.html` at runtime (no disk write needed). If that's also failing, check whether a reverse proxy (nginx/Caddy) is caching a stale `index.html` from before the plugin was installed. Clear the proxy cache or restart it.

### NixOS (read-only `/nix/store`)

NixOS serves Jellyfin's web files from the immutable Nix store, so neither the disk patcher nor the middleware can modify `index.html`. Use a NixOS overlay to inject the script tags at build time:

```nix
nixpkgs.overlays = [
  (final: prev: {
    jellyfin-web = prev.jellyfin-web.overrideAttrs (finalAttrs: previousAttrs: {
      installPhase = ''
        runHook preInstall
        sed -i 's#</body>#<!-- achievementbadges-bootstrap --><script src="/Plugins/AchievementBadges/client-script/sidebar"></script><script src="/Plugins/AchievementBadges/client-script/standalone" defer></script><script src="/Plugins/AchievementBadges/client-script/enhance" defer></script></body>#' dist/index.html
        mkdir -p $out/share
        cp -a dist $out/share/jellyfin-web
        runHook postInstall
      '';
    });
  })
];
```

The plugin DLL serves the JS files from embedded resources — the three `<script>` tags just tell the browser to load them. Rebuild your NixOS config after adding the overlay and restart Jellyfin.

## 📸 Screenshots

### Xbox-style unlock toast
Pops up during playback when a badge unlocks. Xbox circle pops in with pulse rings, expands into a banner, trophy rotates (or diamond spritesheet for rare unlocks), text slides up, shimmer sweeps across, then everything collapses. Per-rarity color, glow, and sound.

<p align="center">
  <img alt="Xbox-style unlock toast" src="assets/achievement-animated.gif" />
</p>

> **Live demo:** download [`achievement-combined.html`](assets/achievement-combined.html) (regular) or [`achievement-combined-rare.html`](assets/achievement-combined-rare.html) (rare with diamond) and open in a browser. Click anywhere to start the sound. Loops every 10.5s.

### The standalone Achievements page
The full profile view, shown in the Jellyfin sidebar. Rank progress bar, day streak, score, completion percentage, and the tab bar for the seven sub-views (My Badges, Quests, Recap, Leaderboard, Compare, Activity, Wrapped, Stats).

<p align="center">
  <img alt="Achievements page" src="assets/screenshots/achievements-page.png" />
</p>

### Badge grid
171 badges across 30+ categories, each with live progress bars and an Equip button. Unlocked badges show in color with a green status tag; locked badges dim. Rarity-colored borders let you scan the grid visually.

## 🙏 Credits & thanks

- **[@frenchyx24](https://github.com/frenchyx24)** — **full French translation of all 171 built-in badges** (hand-translated titles + descriptions, merged in v1.7.2 from [issue #5](https://github.com/ZL154/AchievementBadges_for_Jellyfin/issues/5)). Also filed the original multi-language feature request and the deactivate-equipped-badges / quest-customization / Xbox-logo bug reports that shaped v1.6.1 → v1.7.x. Merci beaucoup !
- **xdnewlun1 (Techno Cricket, CCDC)** — responsible disclosure of 12 security findings in v1.6.0 including the critical IDOR that led to the `UserOwnershipFilter`.
- **Uenify** — the Xbox-style toast animation (circle grow, banner sweep, shimmer, text slide) is a port of his [CodePen](https://codepen.io/uenify) to vanilla JS + per-rarity colour palettes.
- Translations for es / de / it / pt / zh-CN / ja started from an automated pass — native-speaker polish welcomed via PR.

# Third-party components and attributions

This plugin is a third-party extension for [Jellyfin](https://jellyfin.org/)
and is not affiliated with or endorsed by the Jellyfin project. Jellyfin
itself is licensed under the GNU General Public License v2.0.

## NuGet packages referenced at build time

The plugin references the following NuGet packages at build time, which
remain the property of their respective authors and retain their own

## UI inspiration

The Xbox-style unlock toast animation is inspired by Adam Cosman's
[Xbox One Achievement codepen](https://codepen.io/AdamCosman/pen/eYpNYgy)
and was reimplemented from scratch for this project. No original assets
from that codepen are redistributed with this plugin.

## Icons

Material Icons referenced in the UI are provided by Jellyfin's own web
client and are licensed under Apache 2.0 by Google.

Two pieces of artwork in `assets/` embed Material Icons glyphs directly,
under the same Apache 2.0 license: the unlock toast
(`achievement-animated.svg`, the trophy) and the plugin card
(`plugin-card.svg` and its PNG, the trophy, star and verified user).
